## Required Reading

> In JavaScript, most things are objects, from core JavaScript features like arrays to the browser APIs built on top of JavaScript. You can even create your own objects to encapsulate related functions and variables into efficient packages and act as handy data containers. The object-based nature of JavaScript is important to understand if you want to go further with your knowledge of the language,

## Questions

1. What kind of data can you store in an object?

   ```
   Related properties (or keys) and their value can be stored in an object. Functions can also be stored in an object. A collection of properties in the object would describe the object. For example:

   let myskeleton = {
       head: "big",
       arms: "small",
       legs: "medium",
       greeting: function hello(){
           alert("Hi I am Mr Skeleton and I have a" + this.head + "head.")
       };
   };
   ```

1. What's a good use case for using objects?

   ```
   Objects are a great tool for sending out a series of structured, related data items such as to a server. It is far more efficient to send out a single oject containing these items than sending all the items individually.

1. Using a "Fist to Five", what is your comfort and clarity level?

   Comfort: 4

   Clarity: 4
   ```
